Behaviour-Driven Development features for Check-In. Run the tests yourself in wth

## Features

Features of Check-In that we test for are described in the `[features](features)` directory

## Executing tests

To execute tests, you need:

  - ruby and bundler
  - Cucumber
  - selenium and gecko web driver

Once you have those, just run `cucumber` if you want to see what happens, or `test.sh` if you want to send test coverage results to [cucumber.pro](https://app.cucumber.pro)
