# Features

We want to test the behaviour of our system in certain desirable cases, as well as check for antipatterns.
There are a few features which Check-In should have

## Community and Social AAI

There are some community identity providers which should be visible and usable.

## edugain search

The identity providers from edugain should be searchable and a sane subset of them should work.
